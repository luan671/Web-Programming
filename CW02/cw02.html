            Verse:<br>
            Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
            I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
            She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
            In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

            Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
            Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
            Didn't make sense not to live for fun
            Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
            So much to do, so much to see
            So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
            You'll never know if you don't go
            You'll never shine if you don't glow
        </span></p>

            Chorus:<br>
            Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
            Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
            And all that glitters is gold
            Only shooting stars break the mold

            Since all pages need to link to the school homepage. A theme for the home page needs to be determined first, components including 
            the theme color(could be the taken from school badge). <br>This can be acheieved by creating a .background class Also, the school badge 
            needs to be be displayed using either span or div elements paired with a pseudo-class.<br><br>
            .theme_color {theme color throughout website}<br>
            .badge {background image: url(school-badge.gif)}<br>
            <#title> tags need to be standarized to make navigating through website easier<br>
            <#head> tag pared with a .school_name{fonts, colors, location} class to display school name on main sites<br>
            A .dept_name{fonts, colors, location} inherented from school_name to display department names on department sites, essential changes can be made<br>
            Multiple pseudo-class point to <#table> tag to achieve calendar, timetable<br>
            Use :hover{color:***} link state to standarize all the hover action throughout website<br>
            A <#footer> tag to dispay info like address, phone num, etc.<br>
            Multiple <#a href=url> links to school/departments social media<br>
            The body{margin: ; padding: ; etc.} style sheet can provide a basic layout for most pages<br>
