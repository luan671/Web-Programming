This is a portrait of Galileo by Justus Sustermans,
 made near the end of Galileo's life.
</p>
<p >In the summer of 1609, while in Venice to visit some friends,
Galileo heard about the invention in Holland of a ``spyglass'' that
could make distant objects appear near. Galileo set about to re-invent
it independently. Having constructed a telescope of about twenty
power, he turned it on the sky and rapidly made several key
discoveries.</p>
